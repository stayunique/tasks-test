# tasks-test

The goal is to end up with a super simple task app like this https://tasks-joshfradley.vercel.app/

Please use create react app to make your project

Required features:
  - Ability to add and delete tasks
  - Mark tasks as complete / incomplete
  - Basic validation (do not allow empty tasks)
  - Show total of completed and incomplete tasks
  - Persist the tasks on reloads

In this case there will be no backend, you can just store everything in local storage or with any method of your choice

The design is not important as long as it works!

Please clone this repo and submit it to your own copy

If you have experience with Vercel / Amplify / Netlify feel free to share a link to the deployed project (not a requirement)

Thanks
